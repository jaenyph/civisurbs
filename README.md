# Civis Urbs
### Status
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/phijaen/civisurbs.svg?branch=feature/travis-ci-init)](https://travis-ci.org/phijaen/civisurbs)

Civis Urbs is intended to be a multiplayer city simulation game (simcity-like).  
It is in early development phase and not yet usable.  

The targeted game objectives are :
  - Real-time multiplayer collaborative city editing
  - Each player having a particular role in the city
  - Player experience and reputation would unlock advanced features to manage the city

For the first releases the game will target a simple isometric rendering engine.

Development has just started ! It will be a long way ahead toward the Civis Urbs.
